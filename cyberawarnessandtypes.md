Basic CyberCrimes

Stolen credit card information: 
The most common cybercrime is when a person’s credit card information is stolen and used unlawfully to acquire or purchase goods or services over the internet.

Hacking into a government website: 
Another type of cybercrime is tampering with sensitive government data.

Theft of user accounts: 
Yahoo experienced a serious data breach from 2013 to 2016  that resulted in the theft of three billion user accounts. The attackers gained access to private information and passwords that were used to access user accounts in other online services. Most of this data is available even today on the dark web.

Compromised IoT devices: In 2016, over one million connected devices in the IoT were compromised by attackers who took advantage of existing software vulnerabilities. It is the largest DDoS attack to date and one that caused outages in the global DNS affecting popular services including Netflix, PayPal, Twitter, and many more.
Loss of control and access to content: The WannaCry attack, which was allegedly launched by North Korea, in 2017, unleashed ransomware that locked down content on user devices. This ransomware rapidly spread itself and infected 300,000 computers worldwide. The victims had to pay hundreds of dollars to restore their data.

Phishing campaigns: The phishing campaigns infiltrate corporate networks by sending authentic-looking fraudulent emails to users in an organization and tricking them into performing actions such as downloading attachments or clicking on links. The viruses or malware then spreads to the systems, and, eventually, ends up in the organizations’ networks.

Some other common examples of cybercrimes include the sale of illegal items, such as drugs, arms, or counterfeit goods, illegal gambling, solicitation, production, distribution, or possession of child pornography, etc.
